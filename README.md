# Demoni's website

The site is built into static HTML, JavaScript and CSS files using a tool called
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

The site can be found live on <https://demoniry.fi/>.

We are currently hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), which
automatically pulls all changes to the site from GitHub. It should only take
couple of minutes for the changes to apply.

## Install

If you want to edit the site (either its content or the code) on your machine,
make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed first.

Then you should probably go through the first part of
[the Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/) to get all
the tools right on your development machine.

To get the development server running on your computer, run following on your
command line (i.e. Terminal on MacOS):

```sh
npm install
npm run develop
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000/> on your Favorite Web Browserâ„¢.

## Development

Install [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) on your code editor.
